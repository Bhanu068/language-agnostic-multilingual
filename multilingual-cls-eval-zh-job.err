Using custom data configuration default-language=zh
Reusing dataset xnli (/home/bhanuv/.cache/huggingface/datasets/xnli/default-language=zh/1.1.0/818164464f9c9fd15776ca8a00423b074344c3e929d00a2c1a84aa5a50c928bd)
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/m2m100_418M were not used when initializing M2M100Model: ['lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing M2M100Model from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing M2M100Model from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of M2M100Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/m2m100_418M and are newly initialized: ['model.encoder.embed_positions.weights', 'model.decoder.embed_positions.weights']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the test set  don't have a corresponding argument in `M2M100.forward` and have been ignored: premise, hypothesis. If premise, hypothesis are not expected by `M2M100.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
