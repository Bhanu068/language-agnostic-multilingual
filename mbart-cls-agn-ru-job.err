Using custom data configuration default-language=ru
Reusing dataset xnli (/home/bhanuv/.cache/huggingface/datasets/xnli/default-language=ru/1.1.0/818164464f9c9fd15776ca8a00423b074344c3e929d00a2c1a84aa5a50c928bd)
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt were not used when initializing MBartModel: ['final_logits_bias', 'lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing MBartModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing MBartModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

The following columns in the test set  don't have a corresponding argument in `MBart.forward` and have been ignored: premise, hypothesis. If premise, hypothesis are not expected by `MBart.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
